## 🌍 Relevance to Environmental & Climate Data

Although this project was originally built to predict housing prices, the techniques demonstrated here — including data preprocessing, regression modeling, ensemble learning, and interactive dashboards — are directly transferable to climate and sustainability applications. 

For example, similar models can be used to:
- Predict household vehicle miles traveled based on demographic or geographic inputs
- Estimate greenhouse gas emissions across sectors using EPA or census data
- Develop tools for cities to visualize climate strategies and track progress

I'm deeply interested in applying data science and machine learning to solve real-world environmental problems. This project showcases my technical foundation and ability to build scalable tools that could support emissions analysis and climate policy development — aligning with EcoDataLab’s mission.
## 🔮 Future Work (Climate-Focused Ideas)

I'm currently exploring ways to adapt this project to environmental datasets. Ideas include:
- Using national transportation survey data to predict vehicle emissions
- Applying similar modeling techniques to estimate regional energy usage or industrial emissions
- Creating interactive maps of GHG intensities by state or industry using Folium or Plotly
